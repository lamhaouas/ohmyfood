# ohmyfood
* ohmyfood is my second project learning web development,
* The development is in CSS without Javascript.
* No framework, I used only SASS and CSS animations.
* The whole website is developed using the mobile-first approach and it is responsive on mobile, tablet , and desktop.
## Graphic Effects and Animations
I used:
* animations, keyframes and mixins.
* the 7-1 pattern to write SASS.
* HTML and SASS only.
